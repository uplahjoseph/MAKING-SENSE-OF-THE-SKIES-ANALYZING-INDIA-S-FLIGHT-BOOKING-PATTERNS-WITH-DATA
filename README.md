# MAKING-SENSE-OF-THE-SKIES-ANALYZING-INDIA-S-FLIGHT-BOOKING-PATTERNS-WITH-DATA
## Introduction
India’s aviation industry is not only one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it is also a dynamic reflection of the nation’s economic aspirations, growing middle class, and technological transformation. With over 140 operational airports and a civil aviation market projected to become the third-largest globally by 2026, India’s skies are busier than ever. The post-liberalisation era ushered in a new phase for Indian aviation. From being dominated by state-owned carriers like Air India, the sector evolved with the entry of private players, including IndiGo, Vistara, SpiceJet, Go First, and AirAsia India. These airlines brought competition, innovation, and affordability to the masses. Today, low-cost carriers (LCCs) dominate the market, catering to a population increasingly willing to fly.
In the fiscal year 2023–24, Indian airports handled over 350 million passengers, with domestic travel accounting for nearly 75% of that number. Affordable ticketing, improved airport infrastructure, regional connectivity schemes like UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), and the digitisation of the booking experience have all contributed to this aviation boom. Unlike Western markets, India’s domestic flyers are highly price-sensitive. Fare changes, especially those affected by class of travel, days-to-departure, or seasonal demand, can significantly influence consumer behaviour. Despite this, there’s a growing segment of premium travellers demanding higher service quality, leading to a strong Business Class presence among private full-service carriers like Vistara. The industry’s dual nature, balancing mass low-cost demand with an emerging appetite for luxury and comfort, makes it a goldmine for data analysis.
## Data Overview
For this project, I worked with a flight booking dataset scraped from a major travel website. They include the following; 
- Source and destination cities
- Departure and arrival times
- Flight duration
- Ticket prices
- Cabin class and number of stops
- Route
- Days before departure
  ## Data Source
  This dataset was sourced from Kaggle's Airline Dataset. The dataset captures detailed, date-wise information on airline operations across various Indian cities. It is meant for educational purposes only
  ## Objective
  To evaluate the current state, challenges, and opportunities in the Indian airline industry by analysing stakeholder dynamics, market trends, operational performance, and policy environment to inform strategic decisions, policy recommendations, or investment insights:
- Data Cleaning
- Interactive Dashboards
- Feature Engineering
- Consistent Formatting & Branding
  ## Data Cleaning
  The process began by sourcing Adidas’ sales data from Kaggle. Next came data cleaning addressing the following:
  - Missing values
  - Correcting inconsistent formats
  - Eliminating duplicates
  - Standardising data categories, I added two new columns pertinent to this analysis, which are;
    - Route
    - Days before departure
  This step was essential to ensure the dataset was accurate, reliable, and ready for meaningful analysis
## Chart & Visualization
The dashboard includes the following visuals capturing the unity with the airline's operations in India

## Dashboard Overview
- I designed a fully interactive Excel dashboard that brings all charts together into one streamlined, cohesive view. Key highlights of the dashboard include:
- A clean, well-structured layout with consistent margins and spacing
- Clear typography and precise alignment to improve readability and visual flow
- A harmonized color scheme inspired by Adidas’ branding for a polished look
- Interactive slicers that allow users to filter data across multiple dimensions in real time

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Utilized extensively for Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Dashboard creation.
- Adobe Color: Employed for selecting a brand-consistent color theme.

## Insights 
### Patterns in the data quickly began to surface—and they told a compelling story.
- Some product categories and regions consistently outshined the rest, signaling clear areas of strength for Adidas.
- Monthly sales trends revealed predictable spikes and dips, offering key insights for seasonal planning and targeted campaigns.
- A closer look at sales methods uncovered which channels drive the most revenue, while also pointing to areas where performance could be sharpened through optimization.
## What I Learnt 
### Beyond the insights, this project was a major step forward in my growth as a data analyst.
- I gained hands-on experience in cleaning and structuring messy, raw data, transforming it into something reliable and analysis-ready.
- I discovered the real power of slicers, and how they can turn a static report into an interactive tool.
- I also deepened my understanding of dashboard design—learning how consistency, clarity, and layout can elevate the impact of your visuals. Most importantly, I came to appreciate that Excel isn’t just a spreadsheet tool—it’s a surprisingly powerful (and even enjoyable) platform for serious data analysis and storytelling.
